# Cleaning and wrangling data with Pandas and Jupyter Notebook at CIJ summer School 2017

## Class 1

In the first class we're going to learn how to read in a csv file, create a dataframe, identify different ways it may be dirty and learn some techniques for cleaning up our data set. 

The raw data is called results and should be in a file on your desktop

We will be using the Data cleaning with Pandas-workbook to start with - a complete version is in the repo in case you get into trouble

## Class 2

In the later class we're going to be reading in our new clean data file and looking at different ways of interrogating our data
